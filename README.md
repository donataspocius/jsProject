# jsProject

Plan:

- get data from API (fetch)

- render list of all the cities (with main info visible)

- render full info with city picture after clicking on a card in the list.

- add buttons to city full card - Must visit, 'I've been here already'

- add functionality to the buttons:

  - visited: pop-up to enter date of visit and rate it.
  - must visit: pop-up to enter date of planned visit.
  - after pressing any of two buttons on the card the city goes to the list (either visited or want to visit);

LIST:

- in the main global list of all cities the color changes accordingly (visited vs want to visit).

- on the top of the list add info card with statistics:

  - percentage of visited / want to visit cities in the list;
  - my average rate of visited cities
  - currently best rated visited city name
  - {time left} for the next closest planned travel to {city name}.

- add delete btns to remove on LargeCard (colors back to original), no delete on search large card;
- check if item exists in another list - remove, move to another list
