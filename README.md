# jsProject

Plan:

- get data from API (fetch)

- render list of all the cities (with main info visible)

- render full info with picture after clicking on a card in the list.

- add buttons to city full card - Must visit, 'I've been here already'

- add functionality to the buttons:

  - after pressing the city goes to the list (either visited or want to visit);
  - in the main global list of all cities the color changes accordingly.
  - visited: pop-up to enter date of visit and rate it.
  - must visit: pop-up to enter date of planned visit.

- add submit data to list cards of visited / want to visit cities.
